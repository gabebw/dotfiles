" A :Squirrel command to quickly make note of things you want to fix, but you
" should probably finish up the current task first.
"
" As in "squirrel it away" or avoiding a "Squirrel!" distraction to maintain focus.
"
" Notes are stored in a .squirrel file in Vim's current directory, with a
" timestamp and a link to the file and line.
"
" By the easily distracted Henrik Nyh <http://henrik.nyh.se> under the MIT license.
"
" # Adding to the list
"
"     :Squirrel Rename this to Bar
"
" This will store a reference to the current file and line, with the comment you
" provided and the current timestamp.
"
" To squirrel something away without a comment, do
"
"     :Squirrel!
"
" # Opening the list
"
" All squirreled-away data is stored in a .squirrel file in Vim's current directory.
" You may want to ignore that file in your VCS, e.g. in .gitignore.
"
" Run
"
"     :Squirrel
"
" to open the .squirrel file in a new tab.
"
" It also sets things up so you can use the "gf" command on a "file/path:123"
" line in that buffer to jump straight to that file and line. (Instead of
" having to type "gF".)
"
" Keep in mind that lines may have shifted since.
"
" If you want to remove or change something, just edit the .squirrel file.
"
" Unless you have other commands that start with "Sq" you can probably get
" away with abbreviating them:
"
"     :Sq Rename this to Bar
"     :Sq!
"     :Sq
"
"
" # TODO
"
" - Also store any selected text. README copy for that:
"
"     If you've got text highlighted when you run the command, that text will be
"     squirreled away as well. This means you can write your comment in the buffer
"     instead, or you can make a quick sketch of the change you want.
"
" - Some way to get it in a quickfix list?
" - Don't have an extra trailing newline at end of .squirrel file
