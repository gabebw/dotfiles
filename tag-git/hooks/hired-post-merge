# Run migrations and clean fixtures (so they don't get stale) if there are DB

#
# Q: Why not regenerate the fixtures, rather than just removing them?
# A: Removing them is faster than regenerating them, and will force a rebuild of
#    the fixtures on the next test run. Thus, fixtures will be regenerated
#    exactly when they're needed, but until that point, there's no waiting for
#    fixtures to rebuild.
