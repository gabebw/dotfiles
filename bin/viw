# viw = "Vim which"
# Finds a script file, shell alias, or shell function and edits it.
# If it's an alias or function, it opens Vim right to the line where it's
# defined.
#
# Usage:
#
#     $ viw myalias
#     $ viw git-merge-to

set -e
# `set -e` makes this line `exit 1` (correctly) when `find-location-of` exits 1.
# Unfortunately, `vim $(find-location-of "$1")` does NOT exit early, and tries
# to actually run `vim`.
# So we store it to this temp variable and then run `vim` on it once we get
# past this line.
result=$(find-location-of "$1")
vim "$result"
